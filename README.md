# Bayesian Lasso

Implementation of Trevor Park and George Casella (2008) "The bayesian lasso", Journal of the American Statis- tical Association, 103(482) :681?686

Our project is made of a theoretical part and a practical one. The code for the practical part is given by the notebook code.ipynb. We use python. The modules needed to run the script are pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib and sklearn. The dataset diabetes.txt is the one used in the original paper. We implement the solutions proposed in the paper using a larger dataset where predictors are in predictors_large.npy and the target is in target_large.npy.
